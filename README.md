## Summary
The statistical analysis shows the temperature remains steady year-round making it a plus for the shop sustainability. However, there's other data that should be analyzed to assure sustainability. One additional query that could be performed is precipitation. We know temperature is steady throughout the year, but we do not know if precipitation does too. This one is important as it could highly affect the productivity of the shops. Another query is to see what stations are the most popular. This could give us an insight as to what location would be great in accordance with weather pattern. By adding these two queries, the sustainability of the shop could be more guaranteed by more weather parameters and stability.
